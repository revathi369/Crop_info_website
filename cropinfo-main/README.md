# cropinfo
In this project, We built a website which is useful for farmers as well as the consumers.

-Farmers who are making efforts to cultivate a particular crop with high quality will get benefited. The consumers who are in marketing field 
will get benefited to get the quality product with affordable price. 

-The people who are staying the nearby village itself but couldnâ€™t know about the crop details and prices. 
So, they also will go for the low quality products. But, By showing the product information, its price, its availability etc details,  
the person can easily go there and get bulk of load.
